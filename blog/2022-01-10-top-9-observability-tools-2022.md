In microservices architecture, observability tools enable you to create central dashboards to gauge the health of your distributed systems. Let's explore some top observability tools which can help you in meeting the increasing demands of today's users.

![Cover Image](/img/blog/2023/09/observability-tools-cover.webp)

In today's digital economy, distributed architectures have become the norm. Organizations are also opting for polyglot microservices to boost developer productivity. But how do you manage the operational challenges of such systems?

Customer experience is the key to the success of tech companies of any size, be it startups, mid or large-level enterprises. You need to proactively solve for things like availability and performance of your applications in production.
And that's where observability comes into the picture. A robust observability framework is now critical for maintaining your systems in fine health. Observability is powered by telemetry data - a combination of logs, metrics, and traces.

## What is an Observability Tool?

The aim of observability is to solve customer issues quickly. Creating monitoring dashboards is useless if it can’t help engineering teams quickly identify the root causes of performance issues.

A modern distributed software system has a lot of moving components. So while setting up monitoring, you might not know what answers you would need to solve an issue. And that’s where observability comes into the picture.

An observability tool enables application owners to get answers to any question that might arise while debugging application issues. Usually, an observability tool helps you to monitor three signals - metrics, traces, and logs.


<!-- A good observability tool has many components:

1. It should enable you to generate, sample, process, and emit telemetry data.

2. It should have a good storage system for fast retrieval and long-term retention.

3. It should have a good visualization layer for your teams to consume and take action.

In this article, let's explore the top 9 observability tools in 2023 which can be perfect for your microservice application. -->

## Top 11 Observability Tools in 2024

Now let's explore the top observability tools in 2024.

### SigNoz

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a full-stack open-source APM and observability tool. It captures both metrics and traces with log management currently in the product roadmap. One of the advantages of SigNoz is that it is open-source, so you are not locked in with a SaaS vendor. It can also be hosted within your infra. As such, you don't need to send your data to any third party.

SigNoz enables a full-stack observability stack for your microservice application. Let's see what does a full-stack observability tool entails:

- Generation of telemetry data(logs, metrics & traces)
- A storage backend to store the telemetry data, which is often huge
- A visualization layer for your engineering teams to consume and take actions

SigNoz uses OpenTelemetry - a vendor-agnostic instrumentation library for generating telemetry data. OpenTelemetry is a project under Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is becoming the industry standard for creating portable telemetry data.

<br></br>

### Zipkin

Zipkin is an open source APM tool used for distributed tracing. Zipkin captures timing data need to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. In distributed systems, it's a challenge to trace user requests across different services. If a request fails or takes too long, distributed tracing helps to identify the events that caused it.

Zipikin was initially developed at Twitter and drew inspiration from Google's Dapper. Unique identifiers called Trace ID are attached to each request which then identifies that request across services.

Zipkin's architecture includes:

- Reporters to send data to Zipkin
- Collectors which persist trace data to storage
- API to query data
- UI

Zipkin's in-built UI is limited, and you can use Grafana or Kibana from the ELK stack for better analytics and visualizations.

</figure>

<br></br>

It also includes a dependency diagram that shows how many user requests went through each service. It can help you to identify error paths and calls to deprecated services.

## How to choose the right observability tool?

For applications with microservices architecture, observability tools have become critical to meet operational challenges at scale. Without observability, it is almost impossible for your engineering teams to troubleshoot bugs and assess the performance of your applications. Hence choosing the right observability tool for your application is important. A few questions to ask yourself before selecting an observability tool are as follows:

- Are there any privacy laws that you need to take care of while sharing user's data with a third-party tool?
- Does the pricing suit your budget?
- How easy is it to get started with things like instrumentation?
- How much data do you want to retain?
- Does the tool provide seamless integration between metrics, logs, and traces?

An open-source tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), can be your best option in today's privacy-driven digital economy. Moreover, SigNoz uses open-source standards for instrumentation, and its code can be assessed for quality from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz). Finally, as the tool is open-sourced, you get the support of the community while having access to out-of-box features like a SaaS vendor.

## Getting started with SigNoz

You can get started with SigNoz using just three commands at your terminal.

```jsx
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```

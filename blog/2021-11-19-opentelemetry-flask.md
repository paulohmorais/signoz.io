Instrumentation is one of the biggest challenge engineering teams face when starting out with observability. Instrumenting a distributed application architecture is not easy. Applications now have distributed services as well as distributed teams that might be using multiple programming languages and numerous frameworks and libraries.

<a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry</a> is the leading open-source standard that is solving the problem of instrumentation. It is currently an incubating project under the <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>.

It is a set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(Logs, metrics, and traces). It aims to make telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces) a built-in feature of cloud-native software applications.

### Why use OpenTelemetry?

As might be clear by now that OpenTelemetry helps you to generate telemetry data. You still need a backend to analyze, store and visualize that data. By design, OpenTelemetry is vendor-agnostic. And that's one of the biggest advantages of using OpenTelemetry. It can export data in multiple formats which you can send to a backend of your choice.

In this article, we will use [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) as a backend. SigNoz is an open-source APM that can be used for both metrics and distributed tracing.

Let's get started and see how to use OpenTelemetry for a Flask application.

## Running a Flask application with OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces).

### Installing SigNoz

You can get started with SigNoz using just three commands at your terminal.

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```
<br></br>

For detailed instructions, you can visit our documentation.

[![Deployment Docs](/img/blog/common/deploy_docker_documentation.webp)](https://signoz.io/docs/install/)

When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at: [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301/application)

The application list shown in the dashboard is from a sample app called HOT R.O.D that comes bundled with the SigNoz installation package.

**Running sample Flask app**<br></br>
We will be using the Flask app at this <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-flask-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Github repo</a>.

1. Clone sample Flask app repository and go to the root folder<br></br>
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-flask-app.git
   cd sample-flask-app
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Check if the app is running
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
You can now access the UI of the app on your local host: http://localhost:5002/

To capture data with OpenTelemetry, you need to configure some environment variables and run the app with OpenTelemetry packages. Once you ensure your app is running, stop the app with `ctrl + c` on a mac. So let us see how to run the app with OpenTelemetry packages.

### Instrumenting the Flask application with OpenTelemetry
**Step 1. Opentelemetry Python instrumentation installation**<br></br>

The app folder contains a file called `requirements.txt`, which contains all the necessary requirements to set up OpenTelemetry Python instrumentation. Make sure your path is updated to the root directory of your sample app and run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

:::info
The opentelemetry-exporter-otlp is a convenience wrapper package to install all OTLP exporters. Currently, it installs:

- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http

- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc

- (soon) opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http

The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` package installs the gRPC exporter which depends on the `grpcio` package. The installation of `grpcio` may fail on some platforms for various reasons. If you run into such issues, or you don't want to use gRPC, you can install the HTTP exporter instead by installing the `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http` package. You need to set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable to `http/protobuf` to use the HTTP exporter.
:::

**Step 2. Install application-specific packages**<br></br>

This step is required to install packages specific to the application. Make sure to run this command in the root directory of your installed application. This command figures out which instrumentation packages the user might want to install and installs it for them:

```bash
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```

:::note
Please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of your application before running the above command. The command will not install instrumentation for the dependencies which are not installed.
:::

**Step 3. Passing the necessary environment variables**<br></br>

You're almost done. In the last step, you just need to configure a few environment variables for your OTLP exporters. Environment variables that need to be configured:

- `service.name`- application service name (you can name it as you like)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - In this case, IP of the machine where SigNoz is installed

`IP of SigNoz backend` is the IP of the machine where you installed SigNoz. If you have installed SigNoz on `localhost`, the endpoint will be `http://localhost:4317` for gRPC exporter and `http://localhost:4318` for HTTP exporter.

You need to put these environment variables in the below command.

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz>:4317" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument python3 app.py
```

:::note
Don’t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation. For example, if you use `export FLASK_ENV=development`, it enables the reloader mode which breaks OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
:::


As we are running SigNoz on local host, `IP of SigNoz` can be replaced with `localhost` in this case. And, for `service_name` let's use `Flask_App`. Hence, the final command becomes:<br></br>
**Final Command**


```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=Flask_App OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317" OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument python3 app.py
```

:::note
The port numbers are 4317 and 4318 for the gRPC and HTTP exporters respectively. Remember to allow incoming requests to port **4317**/**4318** of machine where SigNoz backend is hosted.
:::

And congratulations! You have now instrumented your flask application with OpenTelemetry.

Below you can find your `Flask_app` in the list of applications being monitored on SigNoz dashboard.

</figure>

<br></br>

### Troubleshooting

The debug mode can break instrumentation from happening because it enables a reloader. To run instrumentation while the debug mode is enabled, set the use_reloader option to False:
```bash
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5002, debug=True, use_reloader=False)
```
If you face any problem in instrumenting with OpenTelemetry, refer to docs at https://signoz.io/docs/instrumentation/python


## Open-source tool to visualize telemetry data
SigNoz makes it easy to visualize metrics and traces captured through OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

SigNoz comes with out of box RED metrics charts and visualization. RED metrics stands for:

- Rate of requests
- Error rate of requests
- Duration taken by requests


<figure data-zoomable align='center'>

    <figcaption><i>Measure things like application latency, requests per sec, error percentage and see your top endpoints with SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>

You can then choose a particular timestamp where latency is high to drill down to traces around that timestamp.

    <figcaption><i>View of traces at a particular timestamp</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>

You can use flamegraphs to exactly identify the issue causing the latency.

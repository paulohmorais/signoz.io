FastAPI is a modern Python web framework based on standard Python type hints that makes it easy to build APIs. It's a relatively new framework, having been released in 2018 but has now been adopted by big companies like Uber, Netflix, and Microsoft.

FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks currently available and is really efficient when it comes to writing code. It is based on ASGI specification, unlike other Python frameworks like Flask, which is based on WSGI specification.

Instrumentation is the biggest challenge engineering teams face when starting out with monitoring their application performance. <a href = "https://opentelemetry.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >OpenTelemetry</a> is the leading open-source standard that is solving the problem of instrumentation. It is currently an incubating project under the <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>.

It is a set of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument applications to create and manage telemetry data(Logs, metrics, and traces). It aims to make telemetry data(logs, metrics, and traces) a built-in feature of cloud-native software applications.

 One of the biggest advantages of using OpenTelemetry is that it is vendor-agnostic. It can export data in multiple formats which you can send to a backend of your choice.

In this article, we will use [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) as a backend. SigNoz is an open-source APM tool that can be used for both metrics and distributed tracing.

Let's get started and see how to use OpenTelemetry for a FastAPI application.

## Running a FastAPI application with OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a great choice to instrument ASGI frameworks. As it is open-source and vendor-agnostic, the data can be sent to any backend of your choice.

### Installing SigNoz

You can get started with SigNoz using just three commands at your terminal.

```jsx
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/
./install.sh
```
<br></br>

For detailed instructions, you can visit our documentation.

[![Deployment Docs](/img/blog/common/deploy_docker_documentation.webp)](https://signoz.io/docs/install/)

When you are done installing SigNoz, you can access the UI at:Â [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301/application)

The application list shown in the dashboard is from a sample app called HOT R.O.D that comes bundled with the SigNoz installation package.

### Instrumenting a sample FastAPI application with OpenTelemetry

**Prerequisites**<br></br>
Python 3.8 or newer

Download the <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >latest version</a> of Python.

**Step 1. Running sample FastAPI app**<br></br>
We will be using the FastAPI app at this <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-fastAPI-app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Github repo</a>. All the required OpenTelemetry packages are contained within the `requirements.txt` file under `app` folder in this sample app. Go to the `app` folder first.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SigNoz/sample-fastAPI-app.git
cd sample-fastapi-app/
cd app
```
Itâ€™s a good practice to create virtual environments for running Python apps, so we will using a virtual python environment for this sample fastAPI app.

#### Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
<br></br>

**Step 2. Run instructions for sending data to SigNoz**<br></br>
The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary OpenTelemetry Python packages needed for instrumentation. In order to install those packages, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The dependencies included are briefly explained below:

opentelemetry-distro - The distro provides a mechanism to automatically configure some of the more common options for users. It helps to get started with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation quickly.

opentelemetry-exporter-otlp - This library provides a way to install all OTLP exporters. You will need an exporter to send the data to SigNoz.

:::note
ðŸ’¡ The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` is a convenience wrapper package to install all OTLP exporters. Currently, it installs:

- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http

- opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc

- (soon) opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-json-http

The `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` package installs the gRPC exporter which depends on the `grpcio` package. The installation of `grpcio` may fail on some platforms for various reasons. If you run into such issues, or you don't want to use gRPC, you can install the HTTP exporter instead by installing the `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http` package. You need to set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable to `http/protobuf` to use the HTTP exporter.
:::

<br></br>

**Step 3. Install application specific packages**<br></br>
This step is required to install packages specific to the application. This command figures out which instrumentation packages the user might want to install and installs it for them:
```jsx
opentelemetry-bootstrap --action=install
```
<br></br>

:::note
Please make sure that you have installed all the dependencies of your application before running the above command. The command will not install instrumentation for the dependencies which are not installed.
:::

**Step 4. Configure environment variables to run app and send data to SigNoz**<br></br>
You're almost done. In the last step, you just need to configure a few environment variables for your OTLP exporters. Environment variables that need to be configured:

- `service.name`- application service name (you can name it as you like)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - In this case, IP of the machine where SigNoz is installed

:::note
Donâ€™t run app in reloader/hot-reload mode as it breaks instrumentation. For example, if you use `--reload` or `reload=True`, it enables the reloader mode which breaks OpenTelemetry isntrumentation.
:::

You need to put these environment variables in the below command.

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=<service_name> OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://<IP of SigNoz>:4317"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument uvicorn main:app --host localhost --port 5002
```

As we are running SigNoz on local host, `IP of SigNoz` can be replaced with `localhost` in this case. And, for `service_name` let's use `fastapiApp`. Hence, the final command becomes:

`IP of SigNoz backend` is the IP of the machine where you installed SigNoz. If you have installed SigNoz on `localhost`, the endpoint will be `http://localhost:4317` for gRPC exporter and `http://localhost:4318` for HTTP exporter.
      

The port numbers are 4317 and 4318 for the gRPC and HTTP exporters respectively. Remember to allow incoming requests to portÂ **4317**/**4318**Â of machine where SigNoz backend is hosted.

:::note

The uvicorn run command with multiple workers has yet to be supported. Alternatively, you can use gunicorn with the worker class `uvicorn.workers.Uvicorn[H11]Worker`

:::

In that case, the final command will be

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=fastapiApp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument gunicorn main:app --workers 2 --worker-class uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```


**Final Command**

```bash
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=service.name=fastapiApp OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc opentelemetry-instrument uvicorn main:app --host localhost --port 5002
```

And, congratulations! You have instrumented your sample FastAPI app. You can check if your app is running or not by hitting the endpoint at [http://localhost:5002/](http://localhost:5002/).

If you have installed SigNoz on your local host, then you can access the SigNoz dashboard at [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301) to monitor your app for performance metrics.

You need to generate some load on your app so that there is data to be captured by OpenTelemetry. You can use locust for this load testing.

```bash
pip3 install locust
```

<br></br>

```jsx
locust -f locust.py --headless --users 10 --spawn-rate 1 -H http://localhost:5002
```
<br></br>

You will find `fastapiAPP` in the list of sample applications being monitored by SigNoz.

</figure>

<br></br>

If you want to run the application with a docker image, refer to the section below for instructions.

### Run with docker
You can use the below instructions if you want to run your app as a docker image, below are the instructions.<br></br>

**Build docker image**
```jsx
docker build -t sample-fastapi-app .
```
<br></br>

**Setting environment variables**<br></br>
You need to set some environment variables while running the application with OpenTelemetry and send collected data to SigNoz. You can do so with the following commands at the terminal:

```bash
# If you have your SigNoz IP Address, replace <IP of SigNoz> with your IP Address. 

docker run -d --name fastapi-container \
-e OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER='none' \
-e OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES='service.name=fastapiApp' \
-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT='http://<IP of SigNoz>:4317' \
-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
-p 5002:5002 sample-fastapi-app
```
<br></br>

If you're using docker compose setup:

```bash
# If you are running signoz through official docker compose setup, run `docker network ls` and find clickhouse network id. It will be something like this clickhouse-setup_default 
# and pass network id by using --net <network ID>

docker run -d --name fastapi-container \ 
--net clickhouse-setup_default  \ 
--link clickhouse-setup_otel-collector_1 \
-e OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER='none' \
-e OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES='service.name=fastapiApp' \
-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT='http://clickhouse-setup_otel-collector_1:4317' \
-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
-p 5002:5002 sample-fastapi-app
```

<br></br>

If you're running SigNoz in your local host then you can replace `<IP of SigNoz>` with `localhost` and the final command will look like below:

```bash
docker run -d --name fastapi-container \
-e OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER='none' \
-e OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES='service.name=fastapiApp' \
-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT='http://localhost:4317' \
-e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
-p 5002:5002 sample-fastapi-app
```
<br></br>

## Open-source tool to visualize telemetry data
SigNoz makes it easy to visualize metrics and traces captured through OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

SigNoz comes with out of box RED metrics charts and visualization. RED metrics stands for:

- Rate of requests
- Error rate of requests
- Duration taken by requests

    <figcaption><i>Measure things like application latency, requests per sec, error percentage and see your top endpoints with SigNoz</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>
You can then choose a particular timestamp where latency is high to drill down to traces around that timestamp.

    <figcaption><i>View of traces at a particular timestamp</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<br></br>
You can use flamegraphs to exactly identify the issue causing the latency.

<br></br>

## Conclusion
OpenTelemetry makes it very convenient to instrument your FastAPI application. You can then use an open-source APM tool like SigNoz to analyze the performance of your app. As SigNoz offers a full-stack observability tool, you don't have to use multiple tools for your monitoring needs.

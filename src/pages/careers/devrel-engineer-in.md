## DevRel Engineer (Remote) (India)


SigNoz is a global open source project with users in 30+ countries. We are building an open-source application monitoring which helps developers monitor their applications and troubleshoot problems, quickly.

In less than a year of our launch, we have reached 14000+ [Github stars](https://github.com/signoz/signoz), 3000+ members in the slack community and 100+ contributors. 


### Company Vision

Software and digital systems are becoming larger parts of our daily lives. Most companies are becoming software companies with increasing part of value they create coming from software. 

In such a world, having software systems functioning seamlessly is taken for granted. Think about last time twitter or slack went down. How irritated you felt.

We aim to solve this problem by providing software engineers better tooling to keep systems running smoothly. We believe there are lots to be done in this space and we need your help in building this future.

If you are developer who loves writing about what you are building and help other devs get started, this role may just be the right fit for you

### Why us?

- Opportunity to work in a global dev infra product 
- Work on an open source product. Engage with the community. Evangelise the product.

### Who would be a good fit
- 1+ yrs experience as a backend/devops engineer. 
- Can get your hand dirty in codes in different languages and deployment methods (think k8s, docker). Not necessary to have deep knowledge, but enough to set up some sample apps
- Active in dev communities like Github or different dev focused slack communities. Open source contributions are a big plus.
- Curious and having a get stuff done attitude
- Interest in startups. If you are an ex-entrepreneur, we would love to chat with you

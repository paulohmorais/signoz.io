            Grafana started as a data visualization tool. It slowly evolved into
            a tool that can take data from multiple data sources for
            visualization.
          </p>
          <p>
            For observability, Grafana offers the LGTM stack (Loki for logs,
            Grafana for visualization, Tempo for traces, and Mimir for metrics).
            You need to configure and maintain multiple configurations for a
            full-stack observability setup.

          <p>
            SigNoz is a single application that provides logs, metrics and
            traces under a single pane of glass. Ingestion, storage, and
            querying of signals are optimized for ease of use and intelligent
            out-of-box correlation between the three signals. There is less
            operational overhead and better developer experience with SigNoz.

          <p>
            OpenTelemetry is the second most active project in the CNCF, with
            only Kubernetes being more active. Using an open source standard
            like OpenTelemetry for generating telemetry signals frees you from
            vendor lock-in. SigNoz is built to support OpenTelemetry from Day 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide features like application exceptions to traces from OTel
            data for fast debugging. Grafana also supports OpenTelemetry. But it
            uses different backends for different signals - Loki for logs and
            Tempo for traces.

            SigNoz uses ClickHouse - a fast open source distributed columnar

              Ingestion is mostly limited by the number of streams that it can

            <li>
              For our test queries, Loki was not able to return the results.
            </li>
            <li>
              Loki took the least amount of storage as it indexed only two keys.

            SigNoz is able to perform fast aggregation queries and also has

          ​OpenTelemetry is the second most active project in the CNCF, with

          OpenTelemetry frees you from vendor lock-in. SigNoz is built to
          support OpenTelemetry from Day 1. New Relic treats OTel data
          differently than data from its own SDKs.

          User-based pricing is outdated. You never know which engineer might
          need to access the monitoring tool for debugging. At SigNoz, we don’t
          charge based on user seats. New Relic’s user pricing can go up to
          $549/user. Even for teams with 10-15 devs, the cost becomes
          significant. At scale, the cost of adding users can go up to 66% of
          the total bill.{" "}

          Dynatrace is one of the top APM products. But it’s difficult to
          navigate its complex UI/UX. There is a steep learning curve, and if
          your company does not have access to its full platform plan, the
          usability reduces.
          <br />
          SigNoz is not gated by any SKU-based subscription. You can access all
          its features in its basic paid plan and pay based only on the amount
          of data you send.

          ​SigNoz supports OpenTelemetry libraries for application

          If your use case requires, you can also run the OpenTelemetry collector

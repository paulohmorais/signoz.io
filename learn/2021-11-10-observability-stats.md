We are not here to get into that debate. Keeping the jargon aside, let's look at what stats say about observability. Is it making a difference for its adopters?

Hybrid multi-cloud systems have become the norm. It is one of the driving forces behind the need for observability. We have compiled 33 stats that show observability is the answer to cloud-native software development.

Let's start by looking at how the cloud ecosystem is shaping up.
